# Rainydays Website CA

The "HTML/CSS" final Course Assignment. This is the coded website for Rainydays builded on the prototype from "Design 1". The site meets the best responsive user experience with mobile and min screen 300px, and desktop min screen 600px.

## Description

My journey has been a struggle with this CA, expecially with horizontal scroll. 4 hours before deadline vscode refused to view images, my boxes was suddenly all over the place and my ctas were not in right position. After struggling with how to fix the problem I reverted the last commit, and had to start over again from there. I am fully aware that I have elements not styled properly, and my html is a mess.

Regarding my prototypes I did a lot of small changes. I tried to focus on color changes after w3c standards, replacing orange with a green color on headers and cta's. Added fixed navbar on mobile version, added message-forms. There is something wierd with my navbar in mobile version on "about" and "contact" page, that I could not figure out. Shopping cart icon is missing and hero-slider was a mess I had to down-prioritize and productlist is a mess. 

When delivering this project I am not satisfied with my final CA, concidering all the hours spent on solving obstacles.
